Hi, hope you're having a good day. 

This app is the result of an idea I had to collect data about my family, and every member in it.

We'll see how far I get with it.

Dev Notes
    These notes are a collection of thoughts and considerations that I jot down while developing.

    This site should have, at the least, a way to view information pertaining to a single individual. Also, a way to move from one individual to any related individual. 

    Further thoughts on possible functionality of the site. Authorization. Users can view data about anyone that they are related to by blood, perhaps to a certain percent of genes? Who knows, this will be interesting to consider. Tired right now...

    Maybe for free you can access data that is within a certain range. Siblings, parents and granparents?
